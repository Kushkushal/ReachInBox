## Project Description

   *Introduction:* "Hey there! Upon opening the app, you’re presented with two options: sign up with Google or create an account."
   
   *Google Signup Flow:* "I'll click the Google signup option. After choosing an email, the server generates a JWT token. This token is securely signed and encodes the user's details, ensuring safe communication."
   
   *Passing JWT in URL:* "The token is passed in the URL as ?token=your_jwt_token, which allows the server to authenticate the user with every request. After this, we land on the main page."

   *Main Page Overview:* "On the main page, there’s a sidebar button to view emails. Clicking it triggers an API call, with the JWT token ensuring secure data retrieval."

   *Keyboard Shortcuts:* "To streamline actions, I’ve added shortcuts: 'D' opens a confirmation window for email deletion, and 'R' opens a reply window."

   *Light and Dark Mode Toggle:* "Finally, there's a toggle button at the top for switching between light and dark modes, enhancing user customization."
